This is a simple game made in Love2D.  I don't claim that it's necessarily "fun", but it does seem pretty stable.  It was made in a couple of days to try and get a feel for Love2D.

Note: I did not make the font "Hack-Regular".  I found the it here: https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack.  I believe that the liscense allows me to use it here but if that is not the case, I am happy to replace it.
